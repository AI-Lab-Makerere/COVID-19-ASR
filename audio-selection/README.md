# Audio Selection Tools

In short, we have more audio than we can use, and lots of the audio isn't good for speech technology. There's sections of the audio with music or background noise, and we don't want a transcriber to listen to it, because it's a waste of that transcriber's time.

So, these tools are used to automatically identify sections of audio that are likely to have human speech, with hopefully a single speaker.
